# Artifacts

This directory contains assets and binary files associated with backlog items.
The structure matches the Item ID:

`./<ITEM_ID>/<filename>`

## Management
- Use `scripts/backlog/workitem_attach_artifact.py` to add files here and link them to the item.
- Large files should be tracked via Git LFS.
