# Deprecated: DBIndex dashboards

Use the unified generated dashboards instead:

- [[Dashboard_PlainMarkdown_New]] (generated by `skills/kano-agent-backlog-skill/scripts/backlog/generate_view.py --source auto`)

Why: `Dashboard_PlainMarkdown_*.md` now supports **SQLite index when available** and falls back to **file scan**
when the DB is missing/stale, so you only need one set of dashboard files.
