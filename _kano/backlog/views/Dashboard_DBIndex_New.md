# Deprecated (kept for backward compatibility)

This repo no longer uses `Dashboard_DBIndex_*.md` as outputs.

Use the demo dashboards (explicitly labeled) instead:

- DBIndex: `views/_demo/Dashboard_Demo_DBIndex_New.md`
- NoDBIndex: `views/_demo/Dashboard_Demo_NoDBIndex_New.md`

Generate them with:

- `python skills/kano-agent-backlog-skill/scripts/backlog/generate_demo_views.py --backlog-root _kano/backlog --agent <agent-name>`
