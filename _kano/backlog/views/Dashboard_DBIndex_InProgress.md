# Deprecated: DBIndex dashboards

Use the unified generated dashboards instead:

- [[Dashboard_PlainMarkdown_Active]] (generated by `skills/kano-agent-backlog-skill/scripts/backlog/generate_view.py --source auto`)

Why: `Dashboard_PlainMarkdown_*.md` now supports **SQLite index when available** and falls back to **file scan**
when the DB is missing/stale, so you only need one set of dashboard files.

If you want to force SQLite as the source, regenerate the unified dashboards with:

- `python skills/kano-agent-backlog-skill/scripts/backlog/refresh_dashboards.py --backlog-root _kano/backlog --agent <agent-name> --source sqlite`
