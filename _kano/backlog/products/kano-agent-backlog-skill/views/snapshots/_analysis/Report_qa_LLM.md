## LLM Analysis

### Key Observations

- _TODO: summarize what the report actually says (no new facts)._

### Risks / Unknowns

- _TODO: list unknowns; suggest what to capture in backlog/worklog._

### Recommendations (Actionable)

- _TODO: propose concrete next steps and verification commands, only if supported by the report._
