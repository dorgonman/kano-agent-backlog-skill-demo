# Context

No visibility into topic usage patterns, lifecycle metrics, or efficiency indicators. Difficult to optimize workflow or identify improvement opportunities

# Goal

Provide insights into topic usage patterns, lifecycle analysis, and workflow efficiency to help optimize development processes

# Approach

Implement analytics collection from topic operations and generate reports on usage patterns, lifecycle metrics, and efficiency indicators

# Acceptance Criteria

Topic lifecycle metrics (creation to closure time), usage pattern analysis, efficiency reports, trend analysis over time, privacy-preserving data collection

# Risks / Dependencies

Privacy concerns with usage tracking - ensure all data is local and anonymizable

# Worklog
