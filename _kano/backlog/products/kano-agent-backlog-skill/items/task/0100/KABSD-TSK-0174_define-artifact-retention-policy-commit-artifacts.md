2026-01-11 16:48 [agent=copilot] Created item
2026-01-11 16:51 [agent=copilot] Decision: commit artifacts/* outputs to git as durable implementation context; keep only derived LLM/analysis outputs under views/_analysis ignored by default.
2026-01-11 16:57 [agent=copilot] Migrated all backlog items to UUIDv7 and enforced strict UUIDv7 validation/generation (no UUIDv4 allowed).
