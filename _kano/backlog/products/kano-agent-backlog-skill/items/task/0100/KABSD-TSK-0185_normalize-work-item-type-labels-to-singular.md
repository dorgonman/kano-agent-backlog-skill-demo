2026-01-12 03:18 [agent=codex-cli] Start: align canonical type labels and directories to singular forms
2026-01-12 03:26 [agent=codex-cli] Aligned work item type directory names to singular: updated canonical TYPE_DIRNAMES, view labels, workitem index registry heading, and tests to create/use singular folders. Attempted to remove old plural item directories but ACL denied; leave for follow-up.
2026-01-12 03:26 [agent=codex-cli] Normalized work item type directories to singular forms across canonical store, views, and tests; plural legacy folders remain due to ACL delete restriction.
