# Context

We need initial profiles to validate the schema and provide defaults.

# Goal

Draft starter profiles for Agile, Scrum, and CMMI.

# Non-Goals

- Perfect mapping to every external tool.

# Approach

- Create minimal profiles based on common work item types and states.
- Keep profiles small and easy to adjust.

# Alternatives

- Ship only one default profile.

# Acceptance Criteria

- Each profile defines item types and transitions.
- Profiles load with the proposed schema without errors.

# Risks / Dependencies

- Profiles may need revision after feedback.
